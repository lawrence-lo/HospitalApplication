# Hospital Project
The hospital project is a Content Management System which reflects an existing hospital. It is a team Capstone project and features Code-First Migrations to create database, WebAPI, LINQ to perform CRUD operations, and the implementation of Administrator functionality (Restricted Access to Create, Update, and
Delete features unless logged in).
